4.4.24
    - meeting held to learn how to use git
    - we cloned our repo
    - Looked around ruston for supplies related to our project
    - secured a pie pan and 3 pvc pipes for possible use in project

4.5.24
    - looked into available parts in the first floor IESB
    - talked with worker asking about stepper motors and controllers
    - got a feel for weights, sizes, and voltages of motors

4.7.24
    - sketched a rough diagram of our project


4.8.24
    - Me and Joe picked up the stepper motors and motor controller from the IESB place
    - I pulled an all-nighter trying to learn how to use the stepper motors, their controllers, and how to wire them
    - I came to the conclusion that the Le Potatoes do not output enough voltage to power the amperage of the stepper motors

4.9.24
    - We came to the conclusion that we need to integrate battery power into our project

4.10.24
    - Created some example GUI's for potential use

4.12.24
    - I went to IESB to buy a battery pack
    - I spent all day researching and asking everyone I knew about how electricity works
    - I learned about how many volts and amps the stepper motors will need
    - I pulled an all nighter learning why my motor isn't working
    - The motors work now!!! (had to macgyver it with some tin foil)
    - The motor's shaft spins correctly (I think), but we need to learn how to properly program it

4.14.24
    - I 3D printed the feet for our design

4.15.24
    - We all got together and used our free printing grams to print all the needed parts for our project
    - We began working on our prototype slideshow

4.20.24
    - I brought home what we had and began bolting together all the available parts
    - I also used a saw to cut pvc pipes to the appropriate lengths and to cut a particle board into a square 
    to hold our project.
4.21.24
    - I took all suplies and began assembly.
    - after bolting, screwing, an attempted solder, cutting, and spray painting... we have completed the main structure
