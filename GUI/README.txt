I need the following images:

- 4 variations of the pie slices diagram, each containing one more adjacent line segment through the center.
- A plus button
- A minus button
- A start button
- A laser alignment button
- An emergency stop button

EXTRA (if we learn how):
    - laser alignment diagram?
